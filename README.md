# restaurant-page
<h1>Restaurant Layout</h1>
<p>This site challenged my design skills and also helped me improve with using flexbox. The layout was completed as part of the 100 Devs program.</p>
<h3>Next time working on this project I would like to improve: </h3>
<ul>
<li>Add logo to the navbar</li>
<li>Improve spacing on the gallery section</li>
<li>Add background and spacing to the hours section</li>

<h4>Thank you for taking the time to look at my project! Any feedback is appreciated.</h4>
